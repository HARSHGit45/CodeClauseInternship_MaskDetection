## Introduction

This project focuses on face mask detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It was completed as part of my internship at CodeClause. The goal is to determine whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a CNN-based model for accurate face mask detection.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's performance.
- **Training Pipeline**: Provides a structured pipeline for training the model.
- **Inference Pipeline**: Enables making predictions on new images using the trained model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
